417 [e] Here's some tips:
417 [e] 
417 [e] Audio from the chroot will now be forwarded to CRAS (Chromium OS audio server),
417 [e] through an ALSA plugin.
417 [e] 
417 [e] Future Chromium OS upgrades may break compatibility with the installed version
417 [e] of CRAS. Should this happen, simply update your chroot.
417 [e] 
417 [e] You can flip through your running chroot desktops and Chromium OS by hitting
417 [e] Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Back and Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Forward.
417 [e] 
417 [e] You can start XBMC via the startxbmc host command: sudo startxbmc
